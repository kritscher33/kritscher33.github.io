    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        I am an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Diego, where I hold a joint appointment in the Department of Mathematics and HalicioÄŸlu Data Science Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I was a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at Stanford University, working with Professor Lexing Ying. Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Professor Shi Jin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recruiting: Graduate students interested in reinforcement learning, interacting particle system, optimization for machine learning problems, please contact me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll move to University of California, Los Angeles in July, 2024.
